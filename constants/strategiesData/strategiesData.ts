The goal is to focus on their joy and sense of accomplishment, and reduce anxiety through planning ahead.",

      "Preparing the bathroom in advance is crucial. Caregivers can gather supplies, make the room comfortable, and monitor water temperature to ensure a safe environment. Safety measures, such as nonskid mats and grab bars, should be in place.\n\nBathing can be an overwhelming sensory experience. Consider all of the five senses - Are you using the same products, so they smell familiar? Is the lighting soothing, yet bright enough so everyone can see clearly? Is there a bathrobe and/or a large towel to wrap up in for warmth and privacy?",

Ask questions, instead of making demands. For example, you can say, "Are you ready to wash up?" instead of "Are you ready to take a bath?"\n\nExperimentation may be necessary to determine whether showers or tub baths are preferred. Distraction techniques, like playing soothing music, can help alleviate resistance.',
